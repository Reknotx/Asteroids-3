This is primarily for reference purposes only for the assignment. You may look at all my code
and take ideas from it as you please. I do NOT codone plagarism and do not affiliate myself
with anyone who may copy from this repository. If you get caught sorry.

This assignment received a 100% so everything is confirmed to be accurate and acceptable for
this project by the grader's standards. It is still possible that something could have been
overlooked so keep that in mind when examining the code.
