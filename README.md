# CSUS-CSC133-Asteroid-assignment-3
A public repository for the CSC133 Asteroid assignment version 3. 
This version implements graphical representations of data and animations with collisions

The goal of the project was to recreate the classical Atari game Asteroids in the Java language
and using the 3rd party library Codename One for graphical display of the program. The program was
written in the Model-View-Controller.
