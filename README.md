# CSUS-CSC133-Asteroid-assignment-3


The goal of the project was to recreate the classical Atari game Asteroids in the Java language
and using the 3rd party library Codename One for graphical display of the program. The program was
designed in the Model-View-Controller software design pattern to help learn new ways of keeping logic
and data separated from one another.

There is a ReadMe attached in the files that has the instructions for how to play.
